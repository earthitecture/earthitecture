Originally from Fiji, I spent most of my early adult years studying, travelling and learning about culture and design.
I majored in Architecture in Osaka, Japan, where I learned much of my Art and Design skills.
I am a firm believer in the concept of IKIGAI, which has led me to a true devotion to Music and the Ocean, 
which are my biggest passions and where I am most comfortable.
I love to enjoy my projects & tasks, individually or with a team.
I am good-humored, open-minded and enjoy the constant learing process in life. 
I love challenges and opportunities, and always set out to accomplish my goals.
